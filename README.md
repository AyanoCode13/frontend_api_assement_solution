# The Assessment

### Objective:

The assessment aims to evaluate applicants' ability to effectively consume and interact with APIs within a React application. Applicants will demonstrate their proficiency in making API calls, handling responses, managing application state, and displaying data fetched from an API.

### Assessment Scenario:

You have been given a task to create a simple post web application that displays a list of posts fetched from a public API. The application should list all the fetched posts, and add a new posts to the list. The following functionalities are required:

### Public API

 - baseurl: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

 - documentation guide: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide

 - get: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

 - post: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts


### What to use

- Axios, as the http client, (has been added already)

- Typescript (has been configured already)

- Redux toolkit for handling the endpoints, hooks generation and state management. (Tips: createApi, configureStore)

### Complete these:

1. Fetch a list of posts from the given API endpoint and display them in a table or a list. Each post item should display these information: 
- userId
- title 
- completed.

2. Provide a form that allows adding a new post to the list.


### Bonus

Ensure the application is user-friendly and visually appealing.
Use any appropriate styling and layout of your choice to enhance the user experience.

### Project Submission

- Upload the project to a GitHub repository containing the source code of the React application.

- A README file with instructions on how to set up and run the application locally.

- A brief explanation of the approach taken to solve the assessment, including any assumptions made.
